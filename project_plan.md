## Advanced Product Lifecycle Management

### Environment Management
- [ ] Set up isolated development, staging, and production environments
- [ ] Implement environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Create promotion workflow from development → staging → production
- [ ] Document environment setup and management procedures

### Secrets and Configuration Management
- [ ] Implement secure storage for environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Set up rotation policies for sensitive credentials
- [ ] Configure application to use different configuration per environment
- [ ] Ensure secrets aren't exposed in logs or error messages

### Security Best Practices
- [ ] Implement OWASP security recommendations
- [ ] Set up dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Configure security headers and CORS policies
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and other API protections
- [ ] Conduct regular security audits

## Post-Deployment Feature Development (Solo Developer Workflow)

As a solo developer, adding new features to a production application requires careful planning to minimize risk and maintain application stability. Here's the workflow we'll implement:

### 1. Feature Development Process
- [ ] Maintain a prioritized feature backlog
- [ ] Use feature branches for all new development (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive tests for new features
- [ ] Utilize feature flags for gradual rollout when appropriate

### 2. Pre-Production Validation
- [ ] Set up a staging environment that mirrors production
- [ ] Implement automated testing in the staging environment
- [ ] Manual testing checklist for critical functionality
- [ ] Performance and security testing before deployment

### 3. Safe Deployment Strategies
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment to minimize downtime
- [ ] Set up automated rollback triggers if monitoring detects issues
- [ ] Schedule deployments during low-traffic periods
- [ ] Use database migration strategies that support rollbacks

### 4. Post-Deployment Monitoring and Operations
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards for key application metrics
- [ ] Configure alerts for abnormal system behavior
- [ ] Monitor user feedback channels
- [ ] Conduct post-release reviews to improve the process
- [ ] Create on-call procedures and incident response plans
- [ ] Document runbooks for common operational tasks
- [ ] Implement automated health checks

## Next Steps
1. Define the specific features of the MERN application
2. Initialize the GitHub repository
3. Set up the basic project structure
4. Begin development of the initial application components
